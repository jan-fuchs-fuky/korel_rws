This service  is the tested for embedding Fourier disentangling into
the Virtual Observatory infrastructure.
Currently the system allows uploading of user data, on-the-fly modification of parameters and management of various
version of Korel and user files. The system uses the well-known interface of electronic shop.
The user can see only his own files (and it is guaranted that nobody (except the administrator) can access his private
files.
<p>

<p>
To achive this the full encryption is used and the user is required to register (create unique account). Before he can
use the service, the administrator has to allow him explicitly.
</p>

<p>
Trusted users (again after permission of administrator) will be able to compile the customized version of Korel 2008 -
different sizes or amount of spectra, spectral regions etc ...
</p>

<p>
More details will be put in future on the server - so read it regularly.
